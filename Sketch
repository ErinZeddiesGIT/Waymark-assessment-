Steps
*- Access file ( Where is File?- Public S3 bucket??)

													-USE PYTHON- 
					-* Heavily comment on code to show thought process-
 *- Deliverable- File with 3 columns- patient_id, enrollment_start_date, enrollment end date. Save as "patient_enrollment_span.csv"
    - Find for each pt id Min(date) and Max(date)

      - crap I cant remember the command for this
        - Run in Jupytr
        - Find commands for dividing columns

		- enrollment_start_date (pk)
		- enrollment_end_date
